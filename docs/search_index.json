The Gibbs sampler involves the following steps in each Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration: 3.3 Algorithm wit code examples: GitHub link: https://github.com/getian107/PRScs We are interestred in two files mcmc_gtb.py and gigrnd.py. First one is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for polygenic prediction with continuous shrinkage (CS) priors (so, algorithm itself). Second one is a random variate generator for the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution from Devroye article. import os 3.4 References: Ge, T., Chen, CY., Ni, Y. et al.
