First one is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for polygenic prediction with continuous shrinkage (CS) priors (so, algorithm itself). Second one is a random variate generator for the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution from Devroye article. import os References: Ge, T., Chen, CY., Ni, Y. et al.
